The study decomposes total projection uncertainty into three well-known sources in climate science: model structure, emission scenarios, and internal variability.\nYou can find my presentation here. \n\n\nDecomposing uncertainty in extreme precipitation scaling rates for future climate projection\n10 May 2024\nJeju, South Korea ‚Äì Korea Water Resources Association Annual Conference\n Extreme precipitation is strongly linked to temperature, as warmer conditions allow the atmosphere to hold more moisture, enhancing the potential for intense rainfall. However, this relationship is found to be highly uncertain. In this talk, I explored the uncertainty surrounding the projected increase rates of extreme precipitation under future climate scenarios.\nI was selected as the Oral Best Presentation Winner for the international session.\nYou can find my presentation here."

    "text": "About me!\nI‚Äôm a climate scientist based in South Korea. My research interests include extreme rainfall projections and their uncertainties.\nI analyze large-scale climate datasets using Python, with a strong focus on uncovering insights from geospatial data. I‚Äôm passionate about data visualization and love bringing climate stories to life through compelling maps and visual narratives. I enjoy translating complex datasets into intuitive visuals that inform and inspire.\nI completed my Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Statistics at Burapha University, Thailand. I then pursued a Master‚Äôs degree at Kongju National University in South Korea, with the financial support of Professor Ahn Kuk-Hyun.\nMy research focuses on the uncertainty of climate projections related to extreme events, particularly extreme rainfall, which plays a critical role in disasters such as floods. I have recently defended my thesis, and you can view my defense slides here.\nüìÑ Download my CV\nüéì Bachelor thesis: Comparing the Performance of the Correlation Coefficients for the Bivariate Mixture Distributions\nüéì Master thesis: Quantifying Uncertainty in Future Extreme Precipitation Projections: A Dual Focus on Scaling Rates and Physical Changes\nüìù Published paper: Decomposing uncertainty in extreme precipitation scaling with temperature in CMIP6 (Journal of Hydrology, IF: 6.789)"
